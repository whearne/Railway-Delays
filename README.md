# Impact of Causes of Delay on Journey Time, Cancellations, and Refund Requests
This project analyses how different causes of train delays impact average journey times, cancellation rates, and the frequency of refund requests. The dashboard provides users with interactive visualisations that explore the relationship between various causes of delays, the length of the journey, and cancellations.


## Project Overview
This project provides insights into how different delay causes—such as signal failures, staffing issues, and weather conditions—affect both journey times and the likelihood of train cancellations or delays. Users can filter the data by departure station and whether a refund was requested, allowing for a detailed exploration of service performance.

## Key Insights
Some of the key insights from the dashboard include:

- **Average Journey Duration**: Staffing issues and weather conditions result in the longest average delays, with journey times exceeding 160 minutes in some cases.
- **Delays vs Cancellations**: Signal failures and weather conditions contribute to the highest number of cancellations and delays. Signal failures in particular have a high proportion of cancellations compared to delays.
- **On-Time Performance**: 86.82% of journeys are on time, while 7.24% are delayed, and 5.94% are cancelled.

## Features
The dashboard includes the following features:

- **Average Journey Time by Delay Cause**: A bar chart shows how each cause of delay affects the average journey duration. Staffing and weather-related delays have the most significant impact.
- **Number of Delays/Cancellations by Delay Cause**: A stacked bar chart breaks down the frequency of delays and cancellations for each cause. It shows the relative impact of each cause on train cancellations versus delays.
- **Journey Status Pie Chart**: A pie chart summarises the percentage of journeys that are on time, delayed, or cancelled.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For creating and designing the interactive visualisations.
- **Excel**: Data storage and preprocessing.

## How to Use the Dashboard
To explore the dashboard, follow these steps:

- **Filter by Departure Station**: Use the station filter to focus on specific departure stations.
- **Check Refund Requests**: Toggle the refund request filter to see how often refunds were requested based on delays or cancellations.
- **Hover for Details**: Hover over the bars in the charts to get detailed data on average journey times, cancellation numbers, and the breakdown of delays.
